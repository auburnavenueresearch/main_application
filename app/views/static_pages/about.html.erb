		<h3>About us.</h3>

			<br>
			<p>
				The Auburn Avenue Research Company is a software engineering consultancy and development firm.<br>
				We are a project-based computer research laboratory working to launch new technology based enterprises<br>
				and provide innovative technology solutions to businesses and consumers. We study and build with the latest<br>
				and most stable open-source technology projects as a business function. The goal of our research is to create<br>
				educational materials, do consultation and tutoring, and conduct research and development projects for future<br>
				products and services.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			We are all using computers a lot more in many new facets of our lives, including in our cars, homes,<br>
			and even our workouts. With computers becoming more and more ubiquitous in our lives, has come the<br>
			creation of many new jobs and opportunities to participate in the tech economy. Our company creates <br>
			products and services that guide people through the process of learning to program and through our<br>
			research, we solve real world business and consumer problems, which take two forms.
			</p>
			<p>
			Education: we are creating a non-traditional learning environment merging both online and personal<br>
			tutoring and workshops. We are currently developing a YouTube series and  promotional computer<br>
			science event tour based on using the Raspberry Pi to learn programming.
			</p>
			<p>
			We are open source evangelists who make appearances at science events, Boys & Girls Clubs, and other<br>
			learning spaces. Our last event was a Raspberry Pi Jam that we hosted at Barnes & Noble during the first<br>
			ever #BNMakerFaire.
			</p>
			<p>
			Contracting: If you have a project that requires python, ruby, java, and/or Linux, we would be happy to<br>
			discuss your requirements.  We also have a computer science tutors available.
